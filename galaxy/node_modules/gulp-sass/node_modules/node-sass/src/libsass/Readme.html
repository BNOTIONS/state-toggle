<p>Libsass is just a library, but if you want to RUN libsass,
then go to <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc">https://github.com/sass/sassc</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/sass/ruby-libsass">https://github.com/sass/ruby-libsass</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/Implementations">find your local implementer</a>.</p>
<p>LibSass requires GCC 4.7+ or Clang/LLVM. If your OS is older, this version may not compile.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Libsass is a C/C++ port of the Sass CSS precompiler. The original version was written in Ruby, but this version is meant for efficiency and portability.</p>
<p>This library strives to be light, simple, and easy to build and integrate with a variety of platforms and languages.</p>
<h2>Developing</h2>
<p>As you may have noticed, the libsass repo itself has
no executables and no tests. Oh noes! How can you develop???</p>
<p>Well, luckily, SassC is the official binary wrapper for
libsass and is <em>always</em> kept in sync. SassC uses a git submodule
to include libsass. When developing libsass, its best to actually
check out SassC and develop in that directory with the SassC spec
and tests there.</p>
<p>We even run Travis tests for SassC!</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>Since libsass is a pure library, tests are run through the <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass-spec">SassSpec</a> project using the <a href="http://github.com/sass/sassc">SassC</a> driver.</p>
<p>To run tests against libsass while developing, you can run <code>./script/spec</code>. This will clone SassC and Sass-Spec under the project folder and then run the Sass-Spec test suite. You may want to update the clones to ensure you have the latest version.</p>
<h2>Library Usage</h2>
<p>While libsass is primarily implemented in C++, it provides a simple
C interface that is defined in <a href="sass_interface.h">sass_interface.h</a>. Its usage is pretty
straight forward.</p>
<p>First, you create a sass context struct. We use these objects to define
different execution parameters for the library. There are three
different context types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sass_context();        // string-in-string-out compilation
sass_file_context();   // file-based compilation
sass_folder_context(); // full-folder multi-file</code></pre>
<p>Each of the contexts have slightly different behavior and are
implemented seperately. This does add extra work to implementing
a wrapper library, but we felt that a mixed-use context object
provides for too much implicit logic. What if you set &quot;input_string&quot;
AND &quot;input_file&quot;... what do we do? This would introduce bugs into
wrapper libraries that would be difficult to debug.</p>
<p>We anticipate that most adapters in most languages will define
their own logic for how to separate these use cases based on the
language. For instance, the original Ruby interface has a combined
interface, but is backed by three different processes.</p>
<p>To generate a context, use one of the following methods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sass_new_context();
sass_new_file_context();
sass_new_folder_context();</code></pre>
<p>Again, please see the <a href="sass_interface.h">sass_interface.h</a> for more information.</p>
<p>And, to get even more information, then please see the implementations
in SassC and SassC-Ruby.</p>

<h2>About Sass</h2>
<p>Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new,
awesome features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind
and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.</p>
<p>Sass was originally created by the co-creator of this library,
Hampton Catlin (<a href="https://github.com/hcatlin">@hcatlin</a>). The extension and continuing evolution
of the language has all been the result of years of work by Natalie
Weizenbaum (<a href="https://github.com/nex3">@nex3</a>) and Chris Eppstein (<a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein">@chriseppstein</a>).</p>
<p>For more information about Sass itself, please visit <a href="http://sass-lang.com">http://sass-lang.com</a></p>
