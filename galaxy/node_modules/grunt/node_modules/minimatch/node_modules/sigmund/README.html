<p>Quick and dirty signatures for Objects.</p>
<p>This is like a much faster <code>deepEquals</code> comparison, which returns a
string key suitable for caches and the like.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething (someObj) {
  var key = sigmund(someObj, maxDepth) // max depth defaults to 10
  var cached = cache.get(key)
  if (cached) return cached)

  var result = expensiveCalculation(someObj)
  cache.set(key, result)
  return result
}</code></pre>
<p>The resulting key will be as unique and reproducible as calling
<code>JSON.stringify</code> or <code>util.inspect</code> on the object, but is much faster.
In order to achieve this speed, some differences are glossed over.
For example, the object <code>{0:&#39;foo&#39;}</code> will be treated identically to the
array <code>[&#39;foo&#39;]</code>.</p>
<p>Also, just as there is no way to summon the soul from the scribblings
of a cocain-addled psychoanalyst, there is no way to revive the object
from the signature string that sigmund gives you.  In fact, it&#39;s
barely even readable.</p>
<p>As with <code>sys.inspect</code> and <code>JSON.stringify</code>, larger objects will
produce larger signature strings.</p>
<p>Because sigmund is a bit less strict than the more thorough
alternatives, the strings will be shorter, and also there is a
slightly higher chance for collisions.  For example, these objects
have the same signature:</p>
<pre><code>var obj1 = {a:&#39;b&#39;,c:/def/,g:[&#39;h&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,{j:&#39;&#39;,k:&#39;l&#39;}]}
var obj2 = {a:&#39;b&#39;,c:&#39;/def/&#39;,g:[&#39;h&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;{jkl&#39;]}</code></pre>
<p>Like a good Freudian, sigmund is most effective when you already have
some understanding of what you&#39;re looking for.  It can help you help
yourself, but you must be willing to do some work as well.</p>
<p>Cycles are handled, and cyclical objects are silently omitted (though
the key is included in the signature output.)</p>
<p>The second argument is the maximum depth, which defaults to 10,
because that is the maximum object traversal depth covered by most
insurance carriers.</p>
